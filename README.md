# Microservices Architecture with Docker and Kubernetes

This project implements a microservices architecture using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestrating the containers. The architecture allows for the development, deployment, and scaling of individual services independently, providing flexibility and scalability for complex applications.

## Technologies Used

- Docker: Containerization platform used to package the microservices.
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration tool used to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of the microservices.
- Programming Languages: [Specify the programming languages used, e.g., Java, Python, Node.js]
- Frameworks: [Specify the frameworks used, e.g., Spring Boot, Flask, Express.js]

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `service1/`: Contains the code and configuration for Service 1.
- `kubernetes/`: Contains the Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying the microservices.

## Setup and Deployment

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the microservices architecture:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Build the Docker images for the microservices:
   - For each service, navigate to its directory and run `docker build -t service-name .`
4. Test the microservices locally using Docker Compose:
   - Run `docker-compose up` in the project root directory.
   - Access the services at the specified ports in the Docker Compose file.
5. Set up a Kubernetes cluster:
   - Choose a Kubernetes setup option based on your requirements (e.g., managed service, local cluster).
   - Install and configure the necessary tools (e.g., kubectl, Minikube).
6. Deploy the microservices to Kubernetes:
   - Apply the Kubernetes manifests using `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/`.
   - Monitor the deployment using `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services`.

## Testing and Monitoring

- Testing: [Describe how to test the microservices, including any unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests]
- Monitoring: [Explain how to set up monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus and Grafana]
